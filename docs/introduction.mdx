<Card title="What is Superglue?" icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone">
  Superglue uses **natural language** to integrate and orchestrate APIs so
  humans can build faster, and agents can reliably execute across apps and data
  sources.
</Card>

Instead of writing complex integration code, you describe what you want in plain English. Superglue figures out how to connect APIs, transform data, handle errors, and keep everything running smoothly.

## How It Works

1. **Connect**: Add integrations (Stripe, HubSpot, databases, etc.) with credentials and documentation
2. **Build**: Describe workflows in natural language - Superglue creates the API orchestration
3. **Run**: Execute workflows that automatically handle authentication, data transformation, and error recovery
