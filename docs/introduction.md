<Card title="What is Superglue?" icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone">
  Superglue uses **natural language** to integrate and orchestrate APIs so
  humans can build faster, and agents can reliably execute across apps and data
  sources.
</Card>

Instead of writing integration code or custom tools for each API, you describe what you want in plain English. Superglue figures out how to connect APIs, transform data, handle errors, and keep everything running smoothly.

## How It Works

1. **Connect**: Add integrations (Stripe, HubSpot, databases, etc.) with credentials and documentation
2. **Build**: Describe workflows in natural language - Superglue creates the API orchestration 
3. **Run**: Execute workflows that automatically handle authentication, data transformation, and error recovery
